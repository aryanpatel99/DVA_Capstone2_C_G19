**How quick-commerce is converting India's weekly grocery list into a daily stream of impulse spending**

This project builds an impulse-proxy scoring model across 13,000 SKUs in 10 Indian cities to quantify what share of Blinkit's revenue is planned necessity versus unplanned convenience — and to price the premium consumers pay for that convenience. The work combines Python-based ETL, exploratory analysis, statistical validation, and a four-page Tableau dashboard suite built for business decision-making.

The core question is:

> What share of Blinkit's sales is driven by impulse behaviour — and how much more are consumers paying per gram for the convenience of small-pack, quick-delivery formats?

## Dashboard Suite

The Tableau workbook is available at [`tableau/workbook/Blinkit_Analysis_G19.twbx`](tableau/workbook/Blinkit_Analysis_G19.twbx), with dashboard screenshots stored in [`tableau/screenshots/`](tableau/screenshots/).

### 1. Market Pulse

![Market Pulse](tableau/screenshots/D1.png)

[View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aryan.patel8829/viz/Blinkit_Analysis_G19/Dashboard1)

This executive summary dashboard anchors the headline KPIs — total revenue, SKU count, impulse share, and the SKU Pareto curve. It establishes the scale of the impulse layer and sets the context for the deeper views.

**Key takeaways**

- **21.6%** of total revenue (₹110.1 M) is impulse-driven; when Mixed baskets are included, **48.8%** of revenue carries an impulse signal.
- The top 20% of SKUs drive **60.3%** of revenue — concentrated, but not a classic 80/20.
- Revenue per SKU is higher in Planned baskets (₹50.9 K) than Impulse (₹29.4 K), while median units sold per SKU are virtually identical (Impulse 124, Planned 120).
- The impulse advantage lives in **price architecture, not in extra volume**.

### 2. Where Impulse Lives

![Where Impulse Lives](tableau/screenshots/D-2.png)

[View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aryan.patel8829/viz/Blinkit_Analysis_G19/Dashboard2)

This category drill-down dashboard shows where impulse revenue concentrates. It uses a category Pareto, a Cat × Basket composition split, a treemap, and a planned-share lollipop chart to identify which categories are impulse-led versus planned.

**Key takeaways**

- Bakery (₹42.7 M), Fruits & Vegetables (₹33.2 M), and Dairy (₹22.2 M) together deliver **89.1%** of all impulse revenue.
- Bakery, F&V, and Dairy are **62–70% impulse-led** by revenue share.
- Personal Care, Grocery, and Household sit above **80% planned** — structurally the opposite of the impulse-core categories.
- The category Pareto and treemap make concentration visible; the planned-share lollipop identifies which categories cluster near the 80% planned threshold.

### 3. Pack Price Ladder

![Pack Price Ladder](tableau/screenshots/D-3.png)

This pricing levers dashboard quantifies the pack-size premium. It uses a pack-box plot, a price-vs-premium scatter, and a demand-driver correlation matrix to show where the margin opportunity lives.

**Key takeaways**

- Median price-per-100g: **₹110** for small packs (<300 g) versus **₹18** for bulk (>700 g) — a **6× pack premium** (Welch t-test: t=49.40, p≈0.00).
- Price-premium correlation is **r = 0.80**, confirming a strong linear relationship between pack size and per-gram price.
- `demand_index` correlates with `sold_quantity` at **r = 0.91** — the single reliable operational lever in the dataset.
- All other variables (discount_pct, impulse_score, price_per_100g) sit near zero correlation with volume, confirming **margin — not volume — is the natural optimisation axis**.

### 4. Geography & Promo Analysis

![Geography & Promo Analysis](tableau/screenshots/D-4.png)

This dashboard covers city-level impulse uniformity and the effect of promotional offers. It uses a city map, ranked bar chart, offer-effect box plot, and a discount-vs-quantity scatter to test whether geography or promotions can be used as targeting levers.

**Key takeaways**

- City impulse share ranges from **17.8%** (Pune) to **24.9%** (Ahmedabad) — a 7.1 pp spread that is within statistical bounds (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.43), supporting a **single national playbook**.
- The offer-effect box plot shows overlapping distributions across promotional and non-promotional SKUs — demand stays steady regardless of offer status.
- The discount-vs-quantity scatter (R² = 0.000) confirms volume is stable across discount depth.
- Promotional spend can be **redirected to higher-leverage levers** (placement, push notifications) without volume risk.

## Business Problem

India's quick-commerce platforms deliver groceries in under 10 minutes, eliminating the friction that once separated a craving from a purchase. This near-zero friction environment creates a structural incentive for unplanned buying — but the exact size and economics of that impulse layer in Blinkit's catalogue have never been quantified.

**Decision supported:**  
This analysis enables Blinkit's category and pricing teams to reallocate assortment investment toward high-impulse categories, reprice small-pack SKUs based on empirically validated premiums, and redirect promotional spend away from discounts that do not drive incremental volume.

## Data Preparation

The cleaned dataset was produced through a structured notebook pipeline:

1. [`01_extraction.ipynb`](notebooks/01_extraction.ipynb) sources and profiles the Blinkit dataset.
2. [`02_cleaning.ipynb`](notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb) cleans, imputes, and engineers the impulse proxy features.
3. [`03_eda.ipynb`](notebooks/03_eda.ipynb) explores revenue distribution, category breakdown, and city-level patterns.
4. [`04_statistical_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb) runs five hypothesis tests and a linear regression.
5. [`05_final_load_prep.ipynb`](notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb) prepares the Tableau-ready extract.

Key cleaning decisions:

- Missing values imputed: median for numeric columns, mode for categorical columns.
- `offer_type` NaN values recoded as "No Offer" to preserve the promotional signal.
- Duplicates removed and text fields standardised.
- Engineered impulse proxy features: `revenue_inr`, `price_per_100g`, `weight_bucket`, `is_perishable`, `impulse_score`, `basket_type`, `city_impulse_index`.
- Impulse score formula: `0.30×is_small + 0.25×is_perishable + 0.25×is_impulse_category + 0.20×has_offer`.

## Statistical Validation

The project validates dashboard patterns using formal tests at α = 0.05.

| Question                                                   | Feature             | Test            | Result                              | Dashboard             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Do small packs charge a pricing premium?                   | `price_per_100g`    | Welch t-test    | Highly significant (t=49.40, p≈0.00) | Pack Price Ladder         |
| Do impulse SKUs sell more units than planned?              | `sold_quantity`     | Mann-Whitney U  | Not significant (p=0.80)            | Market Pulse              |
| Do promotions increase sold quantity?                      | `offer_type`        | ANOVA           | Not significant (p=0.41)            | Geography & Promo Analysis|
| Is impulse share consistent across cities?                 | `city_impulse_index`| Kruskal-Wallis  | Not significant (p=0.43)            | Geography & Promo Analysis|
| Are quantity decisions predictable by standard levers?     | `sold_quantity`     | Linear regression | R²≈0.000 (p=0.675)                | All                       |

The statistical tests reveal a counterintuitive finding: the variables most associated with impulse behaviour (offers, city) do not drive volume. The impulse premium operates entirely through pricing.

## Key Insights

1. **The impulse layer is real and significant.** 21.6% of Blinkit's total revenue comes from SKUs with impulse characteristics. When Mixed baskets are included, 48.8% of revenue carries some impulse signal.
2. **Three categories own the impulse business.** Bakery (38.8%), Fruits & Vegetables (30.2%), and Dairy (20.1%) together account for 89% of all impulse revenue. These are the categories that must receive priority assortment and supply-chain investment.
3. **Fruits & Vegetables, Bakery, and Dairy are structurally impulse-driven.** 62–70% of revenue in these categories comes from impulse-classified SKUs. Personal Care, Grocery, and Household are the opposite — over 80% planned.
4. **Small packs charge a 6× convenience premium.** Median price-per-100g is ₹110 for small packs (<300g) versus ₹18 for bulk (>700g). This difference is statistically undeniable (Welch t-test: t=49.40, p≈0.00) and represents the core monetisation lever in quick-commerce.
5. **Impulse is a pricing story, not a volume story.** Impulse SKUs do not sell more units than planned SKUs (Mann-Whitney U, p=0.80). The revenue premium comes entirely from higher per-gram prices — not from lifting purchase frequency or basket size.
6. **Offers do not trigger impulse purchases.** Promotions do not significantly increase sold quantity (ANOVA, p=0.41). Discount spend is not converting to incremental demand. The impulse decision is driven by category, pack size, and perishability, not price cuts.
7. **Impulse buying is a national urban pattern.** City impulse share ranges from 17.8% (Pune) to 24.9% (Ahmedabad), but this variation is not statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.43). A single national assortment and pricing strategy is more defensible than city-by-city customisation.
8. **The Pareto principle partially holds.** The top 20% of SKUs drive 60.3% of revenue — concentrated, but not the classic 80/20. A meaningful long tail of mid-revenue SKUs contributes to assortment depth and cannot be pruned without consequence.
9. **`demand_index` is a reliable operational proxy.** Correlation between `demand_index` and `sold_quantity` is 0.91 — it can be used confidently in inventory and supply-chain planning without requiring transactional history.
10. **Consumer quantity decisions are not explained by standard levers.** Linear regression of `sold_quantity` on impulse score, offers, price, and discount produces R² ≈ 0.000 (F-stat p=0.675). Volume is driven by factors outside this dataset — likely habit, household need, and availability.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Rebalance assortment investment toward Bakery, Fruits & Vegetables, and Dairy with disproportionate shelf-space and supply-chain priority. | These three categories drive 89% of all impulse revenue.         | Higher impulse revenue capture; reduced stockouts in the highest-margin basket type. |
| 2   | Expand small-pack SKUs in mid-performing impulse categories (Snacks, Beverages) where the premium is currently under-exploited. | Small packs charge a 6× per-gram premium over bulk alternatives. | Increased margin-per-transaction without volume investment.                     |
| 3   | Redirect promotional spend from price discounts to visibility investments — placement, push notifications, in-app placement. | Offers do not lift demand significantly (ANOVA, p=0.41).         | Same or better demand at lower promotional cost.                               |
| 4   | Deploy a single national impulse-assortment playbook rather than city-customised approaches.                                | City impulse share variation is not statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.43). | Faster rollout, consistent margin performance, reduced localisation overhead. |
| 5   | Build pricing models around price-per-100g economics rather than absolute price to optimise margin extraction across pack-size tiers. | Impulse is a pricing phenomenon confirmed by Welch t-test (t=49.40, p≈0.00). | Defensible pricing architecture grounded in empirically validated consumer willingness-to-pay. |

## Conclusion

The Blinkit data shows that impulse buying is not driven by what the campaign industry typically assumes. Offers do not move the needle. Cities do not behave differently enough to warrant customisation. Volume is not the mechanism. Instead, the convenience premium is a structural pricing phenomenon — small packs command 6× the per-gram price of bulk alternatives, and the categories that benefit most (Bakery, Fruits & Vegetables, Dairy) are the same categories that attract the highest impulse share.

The actionable path is clear: prioritise the three impulse-dominant categories, expand small-pack assortment in underserved segments, reallocate promotional budget from discounts to placement, and operate a single national strategy rather than fragmented city-level approaches.

Together, the Python analysis and Tableau dashboards provide a complete decision framework for improving Blinkit's impulse revenue capture and pricing architecture.
